## What is Elixir

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. These capabilities and Elixir tooling allow developers to be productive in several domains, such as web development, embedded software, machine learning, data pipelines, and multimedia processing, across a wide range of industries.

## Graphviz Visualization Tool

Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains.

# Graph manipulation

## Using IEX
Elixir's interactive shell, known as IEx, is a powerful tool that allows Elixir developers to quickly test and evaluate code snippets, define and test functions, and interact with their Elixir applications in real time.

## Creating a Graph
In discrete mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects are represented by abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line).

## Infection Simulator
The module creates a new graph and proceeds by infecting the nodes recursively
