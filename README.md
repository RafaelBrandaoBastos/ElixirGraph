# Creating and manipulating graphs in elixir

## What is elixir

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. These capabilities and Elixir tooling allow developers to be productive in several domains, such as web development, embedded software, machine learning, data pipelines, and multimedia processing, across a wide range of industries.
